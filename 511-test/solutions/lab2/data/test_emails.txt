Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.

After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked "Diplomatic Baggage". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).

I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting
to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as "Precious Stones and Jewellry" in other that its
content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. 

However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account
cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.

Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to
move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. 

This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.

Expecting your response urgently.

Best regards,

Mr. Ben Suleman

CHIEF DANIEL ELEME, PHD, EZE 1 OF ELEME.E-MAIL 
ADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  

ATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. 

This letter might surprise you because we have met
neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe
it is one day that you got to know somebody either in
physical or through correspondence. 

I got your contact through discreet inquiry from the
chambers of commerce and industry of your country on
the net, you and your organization were revealed as
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal
majesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of
Eleme Province in the oil producing area of River
State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in
respect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
State Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. 

This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my
father as compensation by the oil firms located in our
area as a result of oil presence on our land, which
hamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. 

Unfortunately my father died from protracted
diabetes.But before his death he called my attention
and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two
boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment security code number was also
revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a
reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me
in investing the money in a lucrative business as a
result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is
the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move
this money from the security firm to any Country of
your choice for investment purpose. 

So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so
that the funds can be moved in your name and
particulars to any Country of your choice where it
will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the
beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose
particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 

But I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds
reach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so
that we can discuss physically on investment
potentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I
have unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total
money, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which
may arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills
inclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government
money, it is not drug money and it is not money from
arms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of
confidentiality on this matter. I will give more
details about the proceedings of this transaction as
soon as I receive your favorable reply. 

Please reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com
I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous
relationship between my family and your family. 

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,
kindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact. 

I am waiting for your quick response.

Dear sir, 
 
It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. 
I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. 
This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. 
 
My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the "Personal will" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!
urther advise,! no relations or fr! 
iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. 
The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this "SOS" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. 
I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. 
The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. 
Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. 
Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. 
I look forward to your quick response. 
Best Wishes, 
Mrs. Maryam Abacha

PRESIDENT/MANAGING DIRECTOR 
   
Dear Sir/Madam, 
   
Request for Urgent Business Relationship 
   
We are Top Officials of the Federal Government of 
Nigeria Contract Review Panel who are interested in 
importation of goods into our country and 
investing abroad with funds which are presently 
trapped in Nigeria. 
In order to commence this business we solicit your 
assistance, knowledge and expertise to enable us 
recieve the said trapped  funds abroad, for the 
subsequent purchase and inventory of the goods to be 
Imported and the investment abroad. 
   
The source of this fund is as follows: During the 
previous military regimes in our country, government 
officials set up companies and awarded themselves 
contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in 
various ministries. The new civilian government now 
setup  a contract review panel which i and my 
colleagues are members and we have identified a lot of 
inflated sum, due to our position  as civil servants 
and members of this panel, we cannot aquire this money 
in our names. 
I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust 
by my colleagues of the panel to look for an oversea 
partner into whose account the sum of us$31,000 000,00 
(thirty-one million united states dollars) will be 
Paid by telegraphic transfer. Hence we are writting 
you this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
1.  70% for us (the officials) 
2.  20% for the foreign patner(you) 
3.  10% to be used in settling taxation and local and 
Foreign expenses. 

It is this 70% that we wish to commence the 
importation business and the investment abroad. Please 
note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope 
that the funds can arrive your account in latest 
ten(10) banking days from the date of reciept of the 
following information.A suitable company name and bank 
account(company or personel) into which the funds can 
be paid. 
   
The above information will enable us write letters 
of claim and job  description respectively. This way 
we will use your company's name to apply for payments 
and re-award the contract to your company name. 
   
We are looking foward to doing business with you and 
solicit your confidentiality  in this transaction. 
   
Please acknowledge reciept of this letter using this 
e-mail address. 
davidkuta2002@yahoo.com 
I await your urgent response. 

NOTE: ALL CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD BE  CONFIDENTIAL. 

   
Best Regards, 
David Kuta

the death of our father, because of  the  condition of
his death.Before the death of my  father some months
ago he disclosed to me some money and gold he had
deposited in a security company here in ghana. 

The total amount of money which happened to
be$28.3000.000.oo,US Dollars.And gold at 200Kg of
22Karat all in a security vault in ghana.

The document regarding this consignment was handed
over to me by my father before his death, I carefully
search and found the security Company where I
confirmed that the consignment were deposited for safe
keeping in their securit vault in ghana.

The content were deposited as a family valuable, By
virtue of right as the son of my late father, the
security company has accepted to release the
consignment factually.

I am seeking your assistance because my father has
declared the record with the security company stating
that his foreign parrtner shall be the authorised
person to make claim on this consignment becaues of

his consignment in your name as foreign partner to
claim this consignment. For your assistance,I am ready
to give you 10%from the total sum.  This is a risk
free transaction

belonging.

CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.
LAGOS, NIGERIA



ATTENTION:MADAM/SIR

I am MR.USMAN ABACHA , the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.

I have resolved to contact you through this medium
based on business proposal that will be of mutual
benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through
a consultant company base on my research for a
trustworthy and established person that understands
investment ethic for entering into a life time
profitable joint partnership investment and also
co-operation with confidence and trust that you will
keep the contents secret and divulged to any third
party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a
consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.
And since then our client has failed to come forward
to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a
considerable amount of money in demurrage.

Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to
redeem the demurrage which his consignment had
accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.

Since the death of our client President Mobutou
Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to
claim the consignment with us, which means that non of
his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to
secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the
two boxes that were registered as treasurer by our
client actually contained a considerable amount of
money in United States Dollars amounting to about
US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have
been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from
enquiries and the foreign media that our late client
siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was
in office as head of state.

It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault
was part of the money that our client siphoned and now
that he is dead there is no race to this money in our
care.

I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me
in transferring this money out of nigeria to your
country for immediate investment with your assistance.
I have also decided that you will generously be
entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt
of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me
of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and
transfer all the rights of ownership of this
consignment to your name to facilitate your easy
clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your
country.

you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.

Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this
matter.


Thanks.

Yours faithfully.

MR. USMAN ABDUL

Dear Sir,

I am Barrister Tunde Dosumu (SAN) solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Eton Simon, a national of your country, who used to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC)here in Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to  me as my client.  On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife And  their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagbama Express Road. All occupants of the  vehicle unfortunately lost there lives.  Since then I  have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate  any of my clients extended relatives this has also  proved unsuccessful. 

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided  to track his last name over the Internet, to locate  any member of his family hence I contacted you.  I  have contacted you to assist in repatrating the money  and property left behind by my client before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank  where this huge deposits were lodged, particularly, the CITI TRUST BANK where the deceased had an  account valued at about US$14.7million dollars . The bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated within the next ten official
working days. 

Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since
you have the same last name  so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$14.7 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make.

All I require is your honest co-operation  to enable us see this dealthrough. I  guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please get in touch with me via my private email address of barrister_tunde@lawyer.com to enable us discuss further.

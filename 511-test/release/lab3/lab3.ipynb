A common operation in a CNN architecture is [pooling](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#pool), in which you reduce the size of an image by looking at a small window of pixels, say a 4 x 4 window of pixels, and representing that window using e.g., the max/min/mean value of the pixels in the window.\n",

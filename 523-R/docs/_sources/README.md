# DSCI 523: Programming for Data Manipulation

Program design and data manipulation using industry-standard software tools designed for statistical work. Organizing, filtering, sorting, grouping, reformatting, converting, and cleaning data to prepare it for further analysis. This course is not eligible for Credit/D/Fail grading.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:
 
1. Read data into R from vanilla (e.g., `.csv`) and non-standard plain text files, as well as common spreadsheet file types (e.g., `.xls`).

1. Manipulate a single data table in R, to do things such as:
    - filtering rows based on a criterion or combination of criteria;
    - selecting variables;
    - creating new variables and modifying pre-existing ones;
    - rearranging the observations or variables in a deliberate way (e.g., sorting).

1. Define tidy data and explain why it is an optimal format for data analysis involving rectangular data in R.

1. Transform data into the tidy data format in R using `tidyr`. 

1. Understand the key data structures in R.

1. Compare and contrast these relationships to the relationship between `vectors` and `data.frame` objects in R. Move data fluidly between these object types.

1. Manage and manipulate data with dates and times, missing values and categorical variables in R. Rename data frame columns.

1. Work with more than one table (as either separate or nested data structures) in R.

1. Translate fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals into R code.

1. Use the split-apply-combine approach in R to iterate over and summarize data by groups.

1. Understand how to write functions in R, document them correctly and assess if they are correct via unit testing.

1. Know when and how to abstract code (e.g., into functions) to make it more modular and robust.

1. Use a functional programming style as another means of code abstraction in R.

1. Use metaprogramming (in particular, tidy evaluation) to make use of tidyverse functions inside custom written functions in R.

1. Produce human-readable code that incorporates best practices of programming and coding style.

## Lecture Schedule

We will be employing a lot of active learning in this course, as you learn programming best by doing! Typically there will be assigned readings & videos that should be reviewed before each lecture. During synchronous lecture meeting times, I will start with a live demonstration related to the videos you watched beforehand, and then we will work in small breakout groups on a lecture worksheet (a Jupyter notebook) that allow us to practice what was covered in the assigned readings & videos. This synchronous class will be recorded and shared afterwards.
